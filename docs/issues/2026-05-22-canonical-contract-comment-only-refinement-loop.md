## What happened

A QuantDinger workflow card repeatedly failed the canonical story contract gate with a
"Canonical story YAML is missing" error.

The card's backlog refinement notes claimed the story had been refined, but the persisted task
`objective` still contained only a short prose sentence. The canonical YAML was not written back to
the card description/objective, so the gate was correctly rejecting the transition while the agent
looped through comment-only updates.

## Why it matters

The contract gate is meant to stop malformed backlog stories before downstream lanes begin work.
If the prompt allows agents to treat comments or completion notes as refinement evidence, Routa can
produce a false sense of progress and burn repeated lane attempts without changing the gated field.

## Fix direction

- Keep the canonical contract gate strict.
- Make backlog/contract-gated prompts explicit that the YAML must be persisted in the card
  description via `update_card`.
- State that comments, progress notes, and completion summaries do not satisfy the contract gate.
- Add a prompt regression test so future prompt edits do not remove this instruction.
