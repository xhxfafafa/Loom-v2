# desktop backend panics on fresh Windows boot due to Instant underflow

## What Happened

The Windows desktop app can panic shortly after the embedded Rust backend binds to `127.0.0.1:3210`:

```text
overflow when subtracting duration from instant
```

The report notes that the crash reproduces on machines with low uptime, which points to startup code subtracting a fixed duration from `Instant::now()`.

## Why It Matters

The app can exit before the WebView appears. Users on freshly booted Windows systems cannot start the desktop app reliably.

## Root Cause

`DockerDetector::new()` initialized its cache timestamp with:

```rust
Instant::now() - Duration::from_secs(3600)
```

On Windows, subtracting a duration greater than system uptime from `Instant` can underflow and panic.

## Remediation

- Replace direct `Instant - Duration` arithmetic with `checked_sub`.
- Fall back to `now` on underflow while keeping the initial cache state stale through `cached_status: None`.
- Add a regression test for the saturating helper.

## Verification Plan

- `cargo test -p routa-core acp::docker::detector::tests`
- `cargo test -p routa-core`
- `entrix run --tier fast`

## Verification

- `cargo test -p routa-core acp::docker::detector::tests` passed.
- `cargo build -p routa-server` passed.
- `entrix run --tier fast` passed.

## Status (2026-08-16 issue GC)

- The `checked_sub` remediation and regression test (`stale_cache_instant_saturates_on_underflow`) are present on `main` (`crates/routa-core/src/acp/docker/detector.rs`).
- Kept `open` intentionally: linked upstream GitHub issue #554 is still open, and this local tracker records `github_state: open` to avoid status drift. Close both together once upstream closes #554.
